GIF animation
========================================

The ESP32_Animated_Eyes features a GIF mode. By default, the provided folder contains 8 GIF images. Users can use a card reader to store the images on a TF card. After inserting the TF card into the TF module and powering on the device again, it will enter GIF mode and start displaying the GIF images.
